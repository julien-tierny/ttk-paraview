## Enable array selection in Fides reader

You can now choose which arrays should be loaded with the Fides reader.
The arrays to potentially be loaded must still be specified in the JSON data model file, but now you can use vtkDataArraySelection to choose which arrays to actually load.
All arrays specified in the JSON file are enabled by default.
